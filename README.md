## Requirements

- Node.js v22+ (https://nodejs.org)
- pnpm (`corepack enable` + `corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate`)

## Running

```bash
pnpm install
```

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Building

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.

If you're using Apache to serve the site, make sure to set `FallbackResource` to point to `./dist/index.html` so Vue routing works properly.

```xml
<VirtualHost *:80>
  DocumentRoot /your/site/path/here/dist
  FallbackResource /index.html
</VirtualHost>
```
